Hell if I know anymore

What is it?
-----------
A php wordpress clone type thing done back in 2011 I really suggest not running in production unless you went to #YOLOSWAG BRAH



How do I use it?
----------------
	upload all files to a web server and point your browser to '/lair/install.php' then,
	pray to jebus that it still honestly works!
